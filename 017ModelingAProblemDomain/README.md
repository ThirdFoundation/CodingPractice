# Collaboration between Jay Springate and Duncan Germain

Create a page (using HTML, CSS, and JS) to model a given problem domain.

Chosen domain: Modeling the budget dynamics of a public library

We modeled the simplified budget dynamics of a public library system. We assumed
that there would be both private patronage and government funding associated
with each library, and created a simple function that generates predicted funds
based off a range of possibility, and indicates whether the library can remain
in business.  CF week 2 exercises
